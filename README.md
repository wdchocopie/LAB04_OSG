* Q2
-   **INPUT Chain**:
    -   This chain handles incoming traffic destined for the local system.
    -   Any packet addressed to the local server is processed here before reaching the application.
    -   Rules in the INPUT chain allow or block traffic that targets the system itself.
-   **OUTPUT Chain**:
    -   This chain manages outgoing traffic generated by the local system.
    -   Any packet created by the system and sent out to another destination is processed by this chain.
    -   Rules here control what kind of outgoing connections or traffic are allowed from the system.
-   **FORWARD Chain**:
    -   This chain deals with packets routed through the system, but not destined for it (i.e., packets passing through a router or firewall).
    -   If the system is configured as a router, it will use the FORWARD chain to determine whether to allow or block packets that are just passing through.
